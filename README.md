# Whole Warrior Concept

This project was inspired by my prior experience in the United States Marine Corps. At the time I didn't have too many responsibilitites which made my everyday life fairly easy to manage. I remember sitting at in my barracks room every night and simply drawing out my plan for the next day on a small 12x24 whiteboard. Life was simple, but the more you succeed and move on in life the harder managing every day tasks becomes. Now I have the following main responsibilities: aspirigin software engineer, father, full time night college student, husband, and dogowner. Although I love doing all of those things, schedules have become more and more difficult to manage. Giving myself 30 minutes to read, and hour to code for myself other than professional development, working out for an hour and wathcing what I eat. All things that can escape ones mind when they are going through their daily routine. I hope this application not only helps me but other people who have multiple responsibities through out the day.

The "Whole Marine Concept" means a true Marine is not only strong physically but also mentally, emotionally, and financially. The goal of this application is to allow everyone to have a clear view over their daily accomplishments and schedule.

- This application will integrate with google sign in/out/up API functions along with google calendar to allow users to manage their day and quickly administer tasks on their calendar. 

- It will integrate with the google books API to allow users to read and buy books through google to give quick acces to their reading material.

- It will work with the myfitnesspal API to allow users to manage their diet and overall fitness journey.

- It will work with a budgeting API to allow users to manage their expenses.
